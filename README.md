Problem Statement - The main problem with a layperson's understanding of law lies in the intricate language
and concepts, leading to misconceptions. Complex legal terminology, unclear documents,
and incomplete knowledge can result in misinterpretation of rights, responsibilities, and
legal processes. Assumptions about uniformity and reliance on myths further compound
the issue. Inadequate research, fear of legal processes, and avoidance of seeking advice
hinder effective legal navigation. Bridging this gap requires simplified legal language,
enhanced legal literacy, and accessing professional advice for accurate understanding and
decision-making.
